##  Uncle George's Idea


> Suddenly George flashed out of the house, 
running through the streets to borrow a chicken from Katie’s sister. 
> Grandma breathed relieved. 
“A small chicken to walk around and pat it,” 
she said to herself. 
“That is all my son wants. 
It is so simple.  Maybe Gary has seen something like that in a book.”


For a moment, the house was silent;
 Gary observing his grandma; the old woman maintaining her faith. 
George would bring a chicken with him.
George came back. His hands were empty. 
The uncle went to the backyard. Grandma’s plan failed.
 Nobody needed to explain what happened.
Katie’s sister hadn’t accepted the idea of lending one of her chickens. 


“I’m feeling foolish. 
Who would believe someone would return a chicken?
 She thought I would keep it,” said George, feeling impotent and frustrated.
A whole family couldn’t find a chicken for a boy.
 George put his mind to work. Who could help them? 
Some minutes later, a light of hope invaded Uncle George’s heart.
His loud voice broke the house’s silence.
 “I know someone who can help us,” said the man, full of joy. 
“Mother, Uncle Denis has some chickens. I’m sure he will help us.” 

As Gary heard George’s words, the boy smiled, waiting for Grandma’s decision.
“George, you know your father’s brother isn’t a good person. 
My grandson has nothing to do with that man.” 
Grandma’s face was brave. Her voice was brave. 
“No, George, Denis is part of the past.”


Gary had never seen Granny speaking that way. 
Nobody has told him about Uncle Denis or why the old woman was mad at him.
