##  The House 

> It had to do with the house. It all started with that house. 
The past Granny would like to forget was coming back to revisit her.
 The boy was sure it was his fault.  

 That small blue house she lived in was one of Denis’ gifts 
when his brother abandoned Grandma to raise twelve children on her own. 
Uncle Denis gave 
her the house when she was facing 
a difficult situation.
With the new house, 
Grandma and his children were able to leave the island, get jobs and survive.   


The family, however, had to repay the house at least five times. 
Recently, Denis even took an old car from one of her children, 
saying they got a house. 
How could a man ask for more money fifty years later? 
“I don’t want Denis in this house?”
George tried to say something. Grandma raised her hand, saying it was over. 
The conversation about the chicken was over. Even Gary understood it. 

The boy left the room. 
The house was silent.
Who would contradict Granny? The old woman was furious. 
Uncle Denis’ name brought back a haunting past. 

It took more than one hour before a small voice came from the kitchen. 
It was Granny granting his son permission to visit Uncle Denis.
Gary smiled, jumped, and walked around, feeling anxious.  
George flashed out of the house. 


It didn’t take long for him to return with a surprise. 
 Gary couldn’t believe it when he saw an old man coming in, 
wearing a brown suit, carrying his chicken. 
He raised his arm.
“No, it won’t be easy like that.
You will have to catch it,” said the man, 
freeing the chicken around. 
The boy smiled, running and running. 
Grandma came to help. Uncle Denis held her hands. 
“It’s my grandson’s job, sister.”  Grandma
 didn’t have time to reply. The boy shouted. 
The chicken was in his arms, 
feeling good. Gary gave the chicken back 
to Uncle Denis and said “Thanks for coming, Grandpa.” 
Grandpa laughed so loud, his laugh filled the house like a fresh breeze.
Everybody laughed.
