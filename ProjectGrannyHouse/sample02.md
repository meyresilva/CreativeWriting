## Granny's Idea

> After a while, she took the courage to bother a neighbor.
 She put her head out of the window and called the woman with a gentle voice. 
> “Katie, I need to borrow a chicken for a few minutes. 
Would you have one?” asked Grandma, trying to solve the situation. 
However, to her surprise, 
it wouldn’t be simple as she imagined. 


“I cannot say I didn’t listen to your grandson asking for a chicken.
 I have no chickens here. I think my sister has.
 Send George to tell her the situation,” said Katie, 
not ashamed to confess she was eavesdropping. 


Grandma called her son George who never
 refused to do anything for the mother, 
but even George rejected the idea. 
Katie’s sister was a gossiper. 
The woman would tell everyone he wanted to steal her chicken. 
Uncle George was an honored man. 


“Such a fuss for a chicken!” George thought, going to the backyard,
 looking at the emptiness as if he were able to create a chicken for Gary. 
It could be a drawing or a paper chicken. 
The man didn’t dare to express what he was feeling.
 He looked around afraid someone could guess his thoughts. 
“It’s just a child’s desire,” George repeated. 


Time was going by. It was almost time to go back home. 
Gary’s mother was already talking about saying goodbye to Granny. 
The hope in the boy’s eyes was vanishing. 
The family would go back to the city in a couple of hours.
Maybe the chicken would still come. Gary tried to convince himself.
