##  Creative Writing 

In this repository I will share some drafts of manuscripts I've been writing recently as exercise for creative writing courses. The first creative writing course I participated in was in London a few years ago, in a black community, and the teacher was a Caribbean writer. At that time, I wrote some poems and a short story about a girl who got a stove for Christmas and became frustrated. People in my classroom enjoyed the story and asked me to keep it safe and revisit one day. I promised them I would but I never revisited that story. 

However, I kept taking creative writing courses, and moving from Europe to South America, and then to the United States and Europe again. Then I decided to put my experiences and emotions on paper as a form of catharsis.


I will include here some drafts that still need some editing.
