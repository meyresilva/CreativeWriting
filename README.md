# # Creative Writing 

In this repository I will share some short stories I've been writing recently as exercises for creative wrting courses. The first creative writing course I participated in was in London, in a black community, and the teacher was Caribbean. At that time, I wrote some poems and a short story about a girl who got a stove for Christmas and got very frustrated. 


> Last year, in a creative writing course, I was asked to write a short story. 
> It was a good exercise to try to put words on paper almost out of the blue.
 *The chicken* came out as something totally unexpected, even for me. 
I collected some images in my memory: houses, grandparents, 
family, children, love. 
> The word reconciliation came out clear as a big concept 
as soon as I started talking about family. 
And children always, or almost always, play this role within families.
