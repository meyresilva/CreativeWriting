# # Creative Writing 

In this repository I will share some creative work I have been doing recently, participating in creative writing courses. 


> Last year, in a creative writing course, I was asked to write a short story. 
> It was a good exercise to try to put words on paper almost out of the blue.
 *The chicken* came out as something totally unexpected, even for me. 
I collected some images in my memory: houses, grandparents, 
family, children, love. 
> The word reconciliation came out clear as a big concept 
as soon as I started talking about family. 
And children always, or almost always, play this role within families.
