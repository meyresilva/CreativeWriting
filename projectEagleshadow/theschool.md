## The School


The school’s architecture was magnificent. Observing LLMS’ building from first floor of Urban Cafe made us proud.
The great halls reminded us of a theatre or a cathedral. The eagle was
not on the roof anymore. The whole school community welcomed the
government’s decision to get rid of it. Hundreds of tales had 
fomented myths and legends about its spooky dark stone wings that seemed to flap.
The eagle’s shadow had haunted students who felt its eyes following them. 	

At the entrance hall, a permanent exhibition presented photos of celebrity alumni: 
scientists, musicians, playwrights, filmmakers, writers, inventors, politicians. 
Some artists and intellectuals had to flee the country to Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil;
some went to jail, and others were murdered during some of our nation’s darkest hours.
