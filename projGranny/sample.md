##  Gary's desire


> In December, a few days before Christmas, Gary visited Grandma’s house. 
He asked the old woman for something quite weird for a boy of his age.
> Granny listened to the boy and asked him to explain what he really 
meant to make sure she understood it.
Her grandson, a ten-year-old boy arriving from the US, 
asked for such a simple thing. How could a boy raised in Washington D.C., 
a neighbor of Barack Obama, 
come up with an idea like that? 
Though Gary’s desire was a surprise for her, the boy conquered the old woman’s 
heart when he said to
Granny all he wanted was to hold a chicken and walk around with her.
