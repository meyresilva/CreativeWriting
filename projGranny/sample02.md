##  Gary's Desire


> In December, a few days before Christmas, Gary visited Grandma’s house. 
He asked the old woman for something quite weird for a boy of his age.
> Granny listened to the boy and asked him to explain what he really 
meant to make sure she understood it.
Her grandson, a ten-year-old boy arriving from the US, 
asked for such a simple thing. How could a boy raised in Washington D.C., 
a neighbor of Barack Obama, 
come up with an idea like that? 
Though Gary’s desire was a surprise for her, the boy conquered the old woman’s 
heart when he said to
Granny all he wanted was to hold a chicken and walk around with her.


“A chicken?” asked Grandma. “Walk around with a chicken?” 
Grandma wanted to make sure that she heard well. 
She left to her backyard, 
wandering and repeating “just a chicken.” 
Some tears almost appeared in her eyes. 
“About ten years ago, dozens of chickens ran around this backyard, my son.
I don’t have any chickens here now.” 

Gary’s face changed a bit. Clouds of frustration and even 
sadness covered his eyes. 
The boy had to pretend everything was fine because his visit couldn’t 
cause any inconvenience. 
His mother had told him a million times not to worry Granny. 
She was 95 years old, his mother’s grandmother.


“Granny, don’t worry, I thought you had a chicken here. 
Tell me stories of the times you had chickens in your backyard,” 
said the boy observing the tidy place. 
Everything was so clean and organized.


“If your mother had told me that you wanted a chicken, 
I would get one for you,” said Grandma. 
The good aroma of coconut oil and fish all around the
 tiny blue house in the middle of the guava trees seemed part of the past.
The small skinny woman took care of everything, 
sweeping every corner as the wind through the windows brought 
the dust back again. 
The old woman cleaned again, talking to herself sometimes.
